# Receipt To Recipe
This app leverages Taggun API as well as Spoonacular API to allow users to scan their grocery receipts and display possible recipes they can make with the items scanned from the receipt. The app is able to also tell users their "missed" ingredients -- this means that if a user is a couple of ingredients short from a recipe, the app will still tell the user the name of the recipe along with the additional receipes they would need to make that recipe.
